This little applet takes in a users annual earnings and calculates what proportion of people earn more than them globally. They can also filter which countries are included in this calculation - this is something I haven't seen in other similar tools (although I didn't look very long, I had a streamlit itch to scratch, and here we are). It is rough. it is unfinished. It still needs work. But I started it on my work laptop and am going to continue on my personal laptop, hence why it is here (on github).
